Cocoa XML - Stefan Arentz, 2008-11-09

*Introduction*

This project contains alternatives for Cocoa's NSXMLParser. This is
work in progress. Documentation, unit tests and examples need to be
added.

This project was initially created because NSXMLParser is not
streaming. It requires the full XML data to be present before it can
parse. his project builds on the expat XML parser and provides parse:
parsePartial: and parseFinal: methods to deal with XML content that
you might not completely have.

The NSXMLDigester is modelled after the Apache Commons Digester
code. It allows you to easily map XML to objects.
